"""HermesOS synthetic outbound-network health probe (fleet egress sweep).

Ported from the hermes-webui fork's ``api/health_egress.py`` as an additive
agent dashboard plugin (no edits to upstream ``web_server.py``). Mounted at
``/api/plugins/hermes-egress/`` by the dashboard plugin loader.

Background: the Hermesdeploy dashboard runs a cron (``probe-instance-egress``)
that hits every running agent and uses per-target results to detect VMs that
can't reach upstream model APIs even when the gateway looks healthy. Designed
around the 2026-05-02 incident where every Proxmox VM lost UDP/53 to Cloudflare,
all chat sends started timing out with ``gaierror``, and the regular health
check stayed green because the HTTPS port was answering fine.

Wire contract (matches the webui original so the sweep consumer is unchanged):

    GET /api/plugins/hermes-egress/check?targets=api.openai.com,api.anthropic.com
    -> 200, {"targets": [
        {"target": "api.openai.com", "ok": true, "durationMs": 42},
        {"target": "api.anthropic.com", "ok": false,
         "errorClass": "gaierror", "errorDetail": "...", "durationMs": 2503}
      ]}

Security: the allowlist is hardcoded so the endpoint can't be turned into an
arbitrary port-reachability oracle. Unknown hostnames in ?targets= are ignored;
an empty/garbage query falls back to probing the full default list.

NOTE (migration): the webui route lived at the public ``/api/health/egress``.
This plugin route is ``/api/plugins/hermes-egress/check`` and rides the normal
dashboard auth. The Hermesdeploy egress-sweep cron
(``dashboard/src/lib/instance-egress-sweep.ts``) must be repointed to this path
and send the per-instance token. See .hermesos/customizations.yaml (health-egress).

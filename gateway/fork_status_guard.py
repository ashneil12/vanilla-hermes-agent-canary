"""hermes-fork: held-lock-keeps-identity-files.

``gateway.status._cleanup_invalid_pid_path`` unlinks ``gateway.pid`` / ``gateway.lock`` whenever
``get_running_pid()`` cannot verify the recorded gateway locally. On Hivra's split-container boxes the
gateway holds the runtime lock from another PID namespace, so a status poll from the dashboard
container would delete a live gateway's identity files, and a second gateway could then lock a fresh
inode (double-run).

For the process's own home (an unscoped query) the lock, not local PID visibility, is the liveness
proof: never cleanup-unlink while it is held. Scoped queries of another profile home and the
lock-inactive path keep upstream's behaviour, and so does upstream's own partial cleanup
(``unlink_lock=False``, newer than the v2026.9.24 tag), which already leaves the held lock alone.
Add-only module; ``gateway/status.py`` carries one rebinding line.
